Sends a series of SQL-like payloads to target URLs in order to **force SQL errors** and record server responses.

## What it does
- Iterates a list of target URLs and sends different SQL/DB-related payloads.
- Looks for common SQL error signatures in the HTTP response bodies.
- Saves a detailed result file for each tested URL (including the raw response body).
